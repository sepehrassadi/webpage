<h3 class="header" id="topics"><span style="padding-left:10px"/> Topics</h3>

This is an advanced algorithm design and analysis course, aimed at undergraduate students interested in a deep dive in theoretical computer science (TCS), 
as well as graduate students doing research in TCS. It is more specialized and in-depth than the undergraduate level Algorithms course (CS 341). We will cover advanced algorithmic ideas (some classical, some very recent), and the theory behind them (theorems, proofs). <br/><br/>

The following is a <span style="font-weight:bold; color:red;">tentative list</span> of the topics that we will cover in this course but definitely not
in this particular order and not all of them (throughout the semester, 
we will <span style="color:green">mark</span> the topics covered actually in the course explicitly in this list):

<br/>

<span style="font-weight:bold;"> Learning outcomes:</span> By the end of the course, the students should be able to design and analyze 
algorithms for a wide range of problems studied in this course as well as new ones, and have a basic familiarity with various algorithmic models of computation
studied in TCS. 

<br/><br/>

<a href="https://ucalendar.uwaterloo.ca/1011/COURSE/course-CS.html#CS466">Official course description:</a> Algorithmic approaches and methods of assessment that reflect a broad spectrum of criteria, including randomized algorithms, amortized analysis, lower bounds, approximation algorithms, and on-line algorithms. Particular examples will be chosen from different areas of active research and application.


<h3 class="header" id="grading"><span style="padding-left:10px"/> Grading</h3>
The final grade for the course will be based on the following weights:
<ul>
  <li> 50% Assignments (4 for 12.5% points each)</li>
  <li> 50% Exams:
  <table>
    <tr>
      <td style="width:50%">  &#8227; Mid-term exam 1: [TBA: early October] </td>
      <td> (25% points) </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td style="width:50%">  &#8227; Mid-term exam 2: [TBA: mid November] </td>
      <td> (25% points) </td>
    </tr>
  </table></li>
</ul> 
There will be <span style="font-weight:bold">no final exam</span> in this course. Participation in lectures is <span style="font-weight:bold">not mandatory</span>
although strongly encouraged. </br><br/>

<span style="font-weight:bold; color:red;">Important note:</span> To pass this course, students
must obtain <span style="font-weight:bold">at least 50% of the class average grade</span> in the assignments and exams categories <span style="font-weight:bold">separately</span>. 

<br/><br/>
The <a href="course-outline-f23.pdf">course outline</a> contains more details on the grading scheme of this course. 



<!--
<br/><br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Assignments:</span> The policy for the assignments are the following: 
<ol>
  <li> Assignments can (and probably should) be done in teams of three students. However,
you should still write their solutions completely independently (in particular, you should understand and be able to explain everything that is written in your solution),
and you should include the name of your collaborators in your solutions. </li>
  <br/>

  <li> The assignments should be typeset in LaTeX and handed in as a single PDF.  Simple instructions on using LaTeX are available
  on the <a href="#latex">course webpage</a> and a template will be released with each assignment. You can also ask any question you have about LaTeX on Piazza. </li> 

  <br/>
  <li> You are allowed to submit two assignments late in total, each for two extra days. You do not need to take permission for 
  using your extensions â€“ simply write on the first page of your assignment that you are using an extension. You will receive zero credit for any homework
  submitted after two days passed the deadline or after you have used both your extensions. Exceptions
  will be made only for exceptional circumstances and you will need to provide a university-issued written
  verification</li>
</ol>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Exams:</span> The policy for the exams are the following: 
<ol>
  <li> Exams should be done individually and, unlike the assignments, no collaborations or discussing the questions/solutions are allowed for the exams. </li>
  <br/>

  <li> [More details on the exams will be announced soon]</li> 
</ol>

<h3 class="header" id="territorial-ack"> <span style="padding-left:10px"/> University Policy on Academic Integrity</h3>

<span style="font-weight:bold">Academic Integrity:</span>
In order to maintain a culture of <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-integrity/">academic integrity</a>, members of the University of Waterloo community are expected to promote honesty, trust, fairness, respect and responsibility. <br/><br/>

<span style="font-weight:bold">Grievance:</span> 
A student who believes that a decision affecting some aspect of their university life has been unfair or unreasonable may have grounds for initiating a grievance
(<a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-70">Policy 70</a>). 
When in doubt please be certain to contact the department/schoolâ€™s administrative assistant who will provide further assistance.
<br/><br/>

<span style="font-weight:bold">Discipline:</span> A student is expected to know what constitutes academic integrity to avoid committing academic offences and to take responsibility for their actions. A student who is unsure whether an action constitutes an offence, or who needs help in learning how to avoid offences (e.g., plagiarism, cheating) or about "rules" for group work/collaboration should seek guidance from the course professor, academic advisor, or the undergraduate associate dean. 

<br/>

For information on categories of offences and types of penalties, students should refer to <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71">Policy 71</a>. For typical penalties check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/guidelines/guidelines-assessment-penalties">Guidelines for the Assessment of Penalties</a>.
<br/><br/>

<span style="font-weight:bold">Appeals:</span> A decision made or penalty imposed under <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-70">Policy 70</a>, Student Petitions and Grievances (other than a petition) or <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71">Policy 71</a>, Student Discipline may be appealed if there is a ground. A student who believes they have a ground for an appeal should refer to <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-72">Policy 72</a>, Student Appeals.

<h3 class="header" id="latex"> <span style="padding-left:10px"/> Resources on LaTeX</h3>
You can download LaTeX for free <a href="https://www.latex-project.org/get/">here</a>. For the purpose of this course, you do not even need to install LaTeX and 
can instead use an online LaTeX editor such as <a href="https://www.overleaf.com">Overleaf</a>. <br/><br/>

Two great introductory resources for  LaTeX are <a href="https://www.tug.org/begin.html">Getting started with TeX, LaTeX, and friends</a> by <a href="http://users.wfu.edu/cottrell/">Allin Cottrell</a>
 (for general purpose LaTeX)
and <a href="http://joshua.smcvt.edu/proofs/tutorial.pdf">LaTeX for Undergraduates</a> by <a href="http://joshua.smcvt.edu/math/hefferon.html">Jim Hefferson</a> (for undergraduates mathematics) 
accompanied by the following <a href="http://joshua.smcvt.edu/undergradmath/">cheatsheet</a> (note that this document use "\( MATH \)" notation compared to the perhaps more
 widely used "$ MATH $" -- both are completely fine in LaTeX). 
You can also use this wonderful tool <a href="http://detexify.kirelabs.org/classify.html">Detexify</a> by <a href="http://kirelabs.org">Daniel Kirsch</a> for finding the
 LaTeX commands of a symbol (just draw the symbol!).  
<br/><br/>
If you are interested in learning more about LaTeX (beyond what is needed for this course), check the <a href="https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/LaTeX">Wikibook on LaTeX</a> and

<h3 class="header" id="inclusion"> <span style="padding-left:10px"/> Rutgers CS Diversity and Inclusion Statement</h3>
Rutgers Computer Science Department is committed to creating a consciously anti-racist, inclusive community that welcomes diversity in various dimensions (e.g., race, national origin, gender, sexuality, disability status, class, or religious beliefs). We will not tolerate micro-aggressions and discrimination that creates a hostile atmosphere in the class and/or threatens the well-being of our students. We will continuously strive to create a safe learning environment that allows for the open exchange of ideas and cherished freedom of speech, while also ensuring equitable opportunities and respect for all of us. Our goal is to maintain an environment where students, staff, and faculty can contribute without the fear of ridicule or intolerant or offensive language.
<br/><br/>
If you witness or experience racism, discrimination micro-aggressions, or other offensive behavior, you are encouraged to bring it to the attention to the undergraduate program director and/or the department chair. You can also report it to the <a href="http://inclusion.rutgers.edu/report-bias-incident/">Bias Incident Reporting System</a>.
