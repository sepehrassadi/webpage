<h3 class="header"><span style="padding-left:10px"/> Overview</h3>
<p>

With the emergence of massive datasets across different application domains, there is a rapidly growing
interest in solving various problems over immense amounts of data. However, even most basic algorithms can become computationally prohibitive when processing massive datasets as the inputs are often too large 
to be stored in one place or read even once. As a result, a new set of algorithmic tools and ideas are needed for computing with exteremly constrained resources. This is the focus of 
<b><i>sublinear algorithms</i></b>, namely, algorithms whose resource requirements (e.g. time or space) are substantially smaller than the size of the input that they operate on. 

<br/><br/>
We will study various advanced algorithmic ideas through the lens of sublinear algorithms in this course. In particular, we consider two most canonical models of sublinear algorithms, namely, sublinear time algorithms and streaming algorithms, 
and cover several key algorithmic techniques in these (and related) models, as well as discuss limitations inherent to computing with constrained resources.

<h3 class="header"> <span style="padding-left:10px"/> List of Topics</h3>

The following is a tentative list of topics that will be covered in this course. 
<ul>
<li> <b> Sublinear Time Algorithms:</b> Which problems can be solved in time faster than even reading the entire input once? 
We will cover sublinear time algorithms for property testing, distribution testing, and graph problems. We will also examine query complexity as a main tool for proving lower bound on
the performance of sublinear time algorithms. 

</li>
<br/>
 
<li> <b> Streaming Algorithms:</b> Which problems can be solved in space smaller than what is needed to store the entire input? We will cover streaming algorithms for statistical estimation, numerical linear algebra, and graph problems. We will also examine communication complexity as a main tool for proving lower bound on the performance of streaming algorithms. 
</li> 

</ul>

Along the way, we will learn about various key ideas such as probabilistic analysis of algorithms, compressed sensing, dimensionality reduction, sparsification, sketching, coresets, etc. that are used extensively in algorithm design as a whole and sublinear algorithms in particular. 

<h3 class="header"><span style="padding-left:10px"/> Grading</h3>
The final grade for the course will be based on the following weights:
<ul>
<li> 40% Problem sets</li>
<li> 40% Project </li>
<li> 20% Scribe notes </li>
</ul>	

More details on the grading will be posted soon. 

<!--
Students are expected to follow <a href="http://academicintegrity.rutgers.edu/academic-integrity-at-rutgers/">Rutgers academic integrity policy</a> for all their work in this course. 
See the <a href="cs514-s20/course-syllabus.pdf">course syllabus</a> for more information. <br/><br/>


<span style="font-weight:bold">Problem sets:</span> There will be <strike>three</strike> two problem sets in the course and a tentative schedule of release and due dates are available on the 
<a href="#course-calendar">course calendar</a>. <span> Solutions must be typeset in LaTeX and submitted via <a href="https://canvas.rutgers.edu/">Canvas</a> <span style="font-weight:bold">by 11:59pm EST on 
Tuesday</span> the problem set is due</span>. Problem sets can (and probably should) be done in teams of up to three students. However, (1) the students should write their solutions completely independently (in particular, you should understand and be able to explain everything that is written in your solution); (2) you should include the name of your collaborators in your solutions. 

<br/><br/>
<b style="color:red">Update:</b> Due to the recent changes in the course to account for the COVID-19 situation, we are going to only have two problem sets. Instead, each lecture will also contain
 a single practice problem on the topics of the lecture. <b> You do not need to turn in a solution for these practice problems</b>. 


<br/><br/>
<span style="font-weight:bold">Project: </span> There is a final project that will consist of exploring a topic of interest related to this course. This particularly involves reading one or two recent research papers in complete details to get a sense of the background on a research problem and then exploring ideas for addressing this problem. More details on the project will be released later in the semester
in the <a href="#project">Project</a> section. 


<br/><br/>

<span style="font-weight:bold">Scribe notes and participation: </span> 
For each lecture, there will be one team (of one or two students) in charge of taking detailed notes, typing them in LaTeX, preparing any needed figures, and sending them to the Instructor <span style="font-weight:bold">by 11:59pm on Friday</span> after the lecture to be posted on the course website. When preparing scribe notes, please use this LaTeX <a href="cs514-s20/template.tex">template</a>  just edit it to
 include your notes. Further instruction on scribing the notes is available in the template. 

<br/><br/>

<h3 class="header" id="project"> <span style="padding-left:10px"/> Project</h3>

The project can take one of the following forms: 
<ul>
<li style="padding:0.1cm;"> Solve an open theory problem, formulate a new problem, or make some other contribution to the study of sublinear algorithms and/or lower bounds. </li>
<li style="padding:0.1cm;"> Write a survey on a few related papers. A good approach is to first try to solve an open problem, which generally requires reading several background papers first, then switching to a survey
if the problem evades solution. However, even in this case, recording any partial progress is very important.</li>

<li style="padding:0.1cm;"> Implement one or more of the sublinear algorithms studied in the course and compare their performance with standard classical algorithms for the problem on different datasets. 

</ul>


A list of project ideas (including open theory problems and some directions to explore) will be posted sometime in October. However, you are strongly encouraged to approach the Instructor with any project idea you have on sublinear algorithms before this date to pick as your own project -- note that your project does not need to be limited to the topics discussed in class as long as it is (loosly) related to sublinear algorithms. 

<br/><br/>
<span style="font-weight:bold">Project policies:</span> 
<ul>
<li style="padding:0.1cm"> The projects are done in teams of two to three students. Each team needs to submit a single write-up for the project and the presentation time will be split evenly between the team members.
The team members receive the same grade for their project. You are encouraged to discuss your progress on your project with the Instructor and get feedback.   
</li>

<br/>
<!--
<li style="padding:0.1cm"> The write-up for the project is due by the end of the semester. </ul>

<b> Updated Project Expectations and Requirements </b>

<ul>
-->
<li> You should learn a significant amount about your chosen project topic. This will involve closely and carefully reading literature on your specific project topic (likely to be a paper or two). 
You will demonstrate this aspect of your project in the "Background" section of your project report, which should be a clear exposition of the topic in your own words. You can format this according to the scribe notes of the class. Basically, for this portion of the project you should turn in a polished and high-quality set of scribe notes, as if you had been the scribe for a lecture on your chosen topic.</li>

<br/>

<li> You should gain research experience in this area; i.e. make a serious effort to contribute to the state of knowledge on your project topic by (i) identifying an interesting open question or direction for future research related to your project topic; (ii) coming up with an approach to make progress; and (iii) working to carry out your approach. You will demonstrate this aspect of your project by explaining in detail what you did for (i), (ii) and (iii) in the rest of your project report and during your project presentation.</li>

<br/>

<!--
<li> <b style="color:red">New:</b> Instead of the problem set three and the project presentation, you are now required to provide weekly reports on your project following the 
updated timetable below. Exactly one report per group is required and it should be emailed to the Instructor by 11:59PM on the date specified in the timetable. 
-->
</ul>
 <b> Timetable for Projects:</b>

<ul>
<li> Tuesday, November 2: For those of you who are planning to work on the suggested project ideas, send me an email listing your top three favorite projects. For the remainder of you, turn in a brief (1-2 paragraph) project proposal to me by email, describing your chosen topic, the sources you will use, and the portions of those sources that you will cover.
	<br/><br/>
<li> Wednesday, November 3: For those of you who have sent their favorite projects from the list of suggested project ideas, I will send out an assignment of the project. 
</li>
<br/>
<li> Tuesday, November 30: Each group should send me an email containing the preliminary version of your presentation slides and topics you like to cover. </li>
	<br/>
<li> Tuesday, December 7: 20- to 30-minutes presentations in the class for each group, in style of a conference presentation. </li>
<br/>

<li> Tuesday, December 14: Email me a five to ten page report on your project containing the following: 
	<ul>
		<br/>
		<li> A technical summary of the main prior work in the literature, including (1) the formal statement of their result, (2) a high level overview of their proof idea, (3) a lower level description of their proof including the main technical lemmas and claims, and (4) either complete proofs or proof sketches of these technical parts <b> in your own words</b>. This part of the document should be at a level that one could get the full picture of the result you are describing solely based on your write-up. </li>

		<br/>

		<li> A technical summary of your main contributions, including (1) a high level description of a concrete plan for approaching your problem and the type of result you hope to obtain, (2) a lower level set of lemmas and claims that <b> if proven </b> would imply your desired result, (3) either the proofs of the lemmas and claims from the previous part, <b> or </b> concrete and technical reasons for why your attempts failed to prove the desired technical results and any possible update that you came along the way that may allow you to bypass these barriers. For more experiment-based projects, steps (2) and (3) should instead be replaced by description of the exact methodology you used for implementing the algorithms and the experimental results you obtained. This document should be at a level that one (including yourself in near future!) could pickup the project from this part and continue making progress on the main problem.</li>

<h3 class="header" id="latex"> <span style="padding-left:10px"/> LaTeX</h3>

You can download LaTeX for free <a href="https://www.latex-project.org/get/">here</a>. For the purpose of this course, you do not even need to install LaTeX and 
can instead use an online LaTeX editor such as <a href="https://www.overleaf.com">Overleaf</a>. <br/><br/>

Two great introductory resources for  LaTeX are <a href="http://ricardo.ecn.wfu.edu/~cottrell/ecn297/latex_tut.pdf">A Short Introduction to LaTeX</a> by <a href="http://users.wfu.edu/cottrell/">Allin Cottrell</a>
 (for general purpose LaTeX)
and <a href="http://joshua.smcvt.edu/proofs/tutorial.pdf">LaTeX for Undergraduates</a> by <a href="http://joshua.smcvt.edu/math/hefferon.html">Jim Hefferson</a> (for undergraduates mathematics) 
accompanied by the following <a href="http://joshua.smcvt.edu/undergradmath/">cheatsheet</a> (note that this document use "\( MATH \)" notation compared to the perhaps more
 widely used "$ MATH $" -- both are completely fine in LaTeX). 
You can also use this wonderful tool <a href="http://detexify.kirelabs.org/classify.html">Detexify</a> by <a href="http://kirelabs.org">Daniel Kirsch</a> for finding the
 LaTeX commands of a symbol (just draw the symbol!).  
<br/><br/>
If you are interested in learning more about LaTeX (beyond what is needed for this course), check the <a href="https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/LaTeX">Wikibook on LaTeX</a> and

Rutgers CS Diversity and Inclusion Statement
</h3>

Rutgers Computer Science Department is committed to creating a consciously anti-racist, inclusive community that welcomes diversity in various dimensions
(e.g., race, national origin, gender, sexuality, disability status, class, or religious beliefs).  
We will not tolerate micro-aggressions and discrimination that creates a hostile atmosphere in the class and/or threatens the well-being of our students.
We will continuously strive to create a safe learning environment that allows for the open exchange of ideas and cherished freedom of speech, while also
ensuring equitable opportunities and respect for all of us. Our goal is to maintain an environment where students, staff, and faculty can contribute without the fear
of ridicule or intolerant or offensive language. 

<br/><br/>
If you witness or experience racism, discrimination micro-aggressions, or other offensive behavior, you are encouraged to
bring it to the attention to the undergraduate program director and/or the department chair. You can also report it to the 
<a href=http://inclusion.rutgers.edu/report-bias-incident/>Bias Incident Reporting System</a>

<h3 class="header" id="latex"> <span style="padding-left:10px"/>
COVID-19 Protocols
</h3>

In order to protect the health and well-being of all members of the University community, masks must be worn by all persons on campus when in the presence of others (within six feet) and in buildings in non-private enclosed settings (e.g., common workspaces, workstations, meeting rooms, classrooms, etc.). Masks must be worn during class meetings; any student not wearing a mask will be asked to leave.

<br/><br/>
Masks should conform to <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/about-face-coverings.html">CDC guidelines</a> and should completely cover the nose and mouth.

<br/><br/>
If you are feeling sick, or suspect you may have been exposed to COVID-19, do not come to the class. Arrangements will be made for students who are not able to attend class because of an illness or quarantine.
