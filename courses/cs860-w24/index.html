<h3 class="header" id="topics"> Topics</h3>
<p>
  Last decade or so have witnessed major advances in the study of graph algorithms, including solutions to longstanding problems, development of various new tools and techniques,  and introduction of new models and frontiers in research on graphs. This course covers some of the highlights in this area, ranging from fast graph algorithms in classical setting using advanced techniques such as sparsification, convex optimization, graph decompositions, etc., to various modern models of graph 
  algorithms including streaming, sublinear-time, dynamic, and distributed algorithms. 
</p>


<p>
  The course has no formal prerequisite but mathematical maturity, and a strong background in undergraduate-level probability theory, data structures, and algorithm design are all essential. The courseload involves participating in lectures, scribing notes, and solving algorithmic problems. 
</p>

<!--
  This  is an advanced algorithm design and analysis course, aimed at undergraduate students interested in a deep dive in theoretical computer science (TCS), 
  as well as graduate students doing research in TCS. It is more specialized and in-depth than the undergraduate level Algorithms course (CS 341). We will cover advanced algorithmic ideas (some classical, some very recent), and the theory behind them (theorems, proofs). Mathematical maturity, and a strong background in probability theory, data structures, and algorithm design are all essential.
</p>

<p>
The following is a <span style="font-weight:bold; color:red;">tentative list</span> of the topics that we will cover in this course (not
necessarily in this particular order):

<h4 class="sub-header" id="learning-outcomes">Learning Outcomes </h4>
<p>
  I am hoping that by the end of the course, (1) you are able to design and analyze algorithms for a wide range of canonical problems studied in this course, and even more importantly, for new problems that you may have not encountered directly in this course,  (2) you know a wide range of algorithmic and mathematical tools
  commonly used in design and analysis of algorithms, and (3) you have a have a basic familiarity with various algorithmic models of computation studied in TCS. 
</p>

<h3 class="header" id="resources"> Resources </h3>

<p>
  There is no official textbook for the course (most of our material is not in textbooks yet anyway). The following resources are all optional but they can be quite helpful and I encourage you to refer to them throughout the term for more details on the topics we cover in the class. 
</p>

<h4 class="sub-header" id="reading"> Workshop on Modern Techniques in Graph Algorithms</h4>

<p>
  Possibly the best resource to familiarize yourself with the topics of this course is the <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/dimacswmtga">Workshop on Modern Techniques in Graph Algorithms</a> that was held at DIMACS in Summer 2023, organized by <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/prantarg/home">Prantar Ghosh</a>, <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/zihantan">Zihan Tan</a>, and <a href="https://web.eecs.umich.edu/~nswein/">Nicole Wein</a>.

  <h4 class="sub-header" id="latex">  Resources on LaTeX</h4>
    <p>
      You can <a href="https://www.latex-project.org/get/">download</a> LaTeX for free. For the purpose of this course, you do not even need to install LaTeX and 
      can instead use an online LaTeX editor such as <a href="https://www.overleaf.com">Overleaf</a>. 
    </p>

    <p>
      Two great introductory resources for LaTeX are <a href="https://www.tug.org/begin.html">Getting started with TeX, LaTeX, and friends</a> by <a href="http://users.wfu.edu/cottrell/">Allin Cottrell</a>
       (for general purpose LaTeX)
      and <a href="http://joshua.smcvt.edu/proofs/tutorial.pdf">LaTeX for Undergraduates</a> by <a href="http://joshua.smcvt.edu/math/hefferon.html">Jim Hefferson</a> (for undergraduates mathematics) 
      accompanied by the following <a href="http://joshua.smcvt.edu/undergradmath/">cheatsheet</a> (note that this document use "\( MATH \)" notation compared to the perhaps more widely used "$ MATH $" -- both are completely fine in LaTeX). 
      You can also use this wonderful tool <a href="http://detexify.kirelabs.org/classify.html">Detexify</a> by <a href="http://kirelabs.org">Daniel Kirsch</a> for finding the LaTeX commands of a symbol (just draw the symbol!). 
    </p>

Our main campus is situated on the Haldimand Tract, the land granted to the Six Nations that includes six miles on each side of the Grand River. Our active work toward reconciliation takes place across our campuses through research, learning, teaching, and community building, and is co-ordinated within the <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/indigenous/">Office of Indigenous Relations</a>.
</p>

<h4 class="sub-header" id="territorial-ack">  Students with Disabilities </h4>

<p>
  You are encouraged to discuss with me any appropriate accommodations that we might make on your behalf following the guidelines of the
  <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/disability-services/">AccessAbility Services</a>. 
</p>

</p>

<h4 class="sub-header" id="territorial-ack">  Statement of Inclusivity</h4>

I am committed to creating a learning environment in which all of my
students feel safe and included, regardless of race, ethnicity, religion, gender or sexual orientation.
Because we are individuals with varying needs, I rely on your feedback to achieve this goal. I invite
you to let me know about what I can stop, start, or continue doing to make sure every one of my
students feels valued and can engage actively in our learning community.
<br/><br/>

<span style="font-weight:bold">Faculty of Math Statement on Diversity:</span>
It is our intent that students from all diverse backgrounds and perspectives be well served by this course, and that students’ learning needs be addressed both in and out of class. We recognize the immense value of the diversity in identities, perspectives, and contributions that students bring, and the benefit it has on our educational environment. Your suggestions are encouraged and appreciated. Please let us know ways to improve the effectiveness of the course for you personally or for other students or student groups. In particular:
<ul>
  <li> We will gladly honour your request to address you by an alternate/preferred name or gender pronoun. Please advise us of this preference early in the term so we may make appropriate changes to our records.</li>
<li> We will honour your religious holidays and celebrations. Please inform us of these at the start of the course. </li>
<li> We will follow <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/disability-services/">AccessAbility Services</a> guidelines and protocols on how to best support
students with different learning needs.</li>
</ul>

<h4 class="sub-header" id="territorial-ack"> Your Health & Well-Being</h4>

<p>
  This is a challenging course with various advanced topics and  not-so-easy assignments and exams. All of these are going to be time and energy consuming. 
  But, this is also an <em>elective</em> course so one of my main goals is for you to enjoy taking this course
  and learning these cool materials as much as I enjoy teaching them. Part of making sure you have fun involves taking care of yourself. Do your best to maintain a healthy lifestyle and work-life balance this term by eating well, exercising, getting enough sleep, and taking some time to relax -- all of these will tremendously help you to achieve your goals in the course and to enjoy the process in the meantime. 
</p>
<p>
  You can find more resources to help you with your health & well-being with the <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/campus-wellness/">Campus Wellness</a>
  and <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/student-success">Student Success Office</a> -- they have 
  tons of <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/student-success/resources">resources</a> on helping you to succeed, including very good tips on <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/student-success/resources/time-management">time management</a> techniques. 
</p>

<p>
<span style="font-weight:bold;">Faculty of Math Statement on Mental Health:</span> The Faculty of Math encourages students to seek out mental health support if needed:

<h4 class="sub-header" id="territorial-ack">Rights and Responsibilities</h4>

<p>
  Every member  of  this class---instructor, TA, and students---has rights and responsibilities  
  toward having a pleasant, fair, supportive, and free of discrimination and micro-aggression environment in this course, and we 
  are all answerable to the University policies governing ethical behaviour (<a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-33">Policy 33</a>). 
</p>

<p>
  In addition, academic dishonesty and plagiarism is considered a serious offense in this course. I expect that any assignment or exam you submit in this course will 
  be your own product and follows the collaboration and external resources policies specified in the <a href="course-outline-f23">course outline</a>.   
  If an assignment is too hard, start earlier, ask for help, or simply do not answer the question --- academic dishonesty is never the right answer.
  If you have any concerns or questions about these policies, please discuss them with me.  
</p>
<p>
  Finally, a reminder that all the course content including lecture notes, presentations,  and other materials prepared  for the course, are the intellectual 
  property (IP) of the instructor. These course materials are available to you to enhance your educational  experience, and sharing them 
  without permission and proper citation is a violation of intellectual property rights. 
</p>

<span style="font-weight:bold">University Policies</span>: It is your job to know the university  policies  that  govern  your  behaviour in this course. Some pointers are: 

<ul>
  <li>
    <span style="font-weight:bold">Academic Integrity:</span>
    In order to maintain a culture of <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-integrity/">academic integrity</a>, members of the University of Waterloo community are expected to promote honesty, trust, fairness, respect and responsibility. All
    members of the UW community are expected to hold to the highest standard of academic
    integrity in their studies, teaching, and research. The <a href="https://www.uwaterloo.ca/academicintegrity">Office of Academic Integrity's website</a>
    contains detailed information on UW policy
    for students and faculty. This site explains why academic integrity is important and how
    students can avoid academic misconduct. It also identifies resources available on campus
    for students and faculty to help achieve academic integrity in---and out---of the classroom.
  </li>
  <br/>
  <li>
    <span style="font-weight:bold">Grievance:</span> 
    A student who believes that a decision affecting some aspect of their university life has been unfair or unreasonable may have grounds for initiating a grievance
    (<a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-70">Policy 70</a>). 
    When in doubt please be certain to contact the department/school’s administrative assistant who will provide further assistance.
  </li>
  <br/>
  <li>
    <span style="font-weight:bold">Discipline:</span> A student is expected to know what constitutes academic integrity to avoid committing academic offences and to take responsibility for their actions. A student who is unsure whether an action constitutes an offence, or who needs help in learning how to avoid offences (e.g., plagiarism, cheating) or about "rules" for group work/collaboration should seek guidance from the course professor, academic advisor, or the undergraduate associate dean. 
    <br/>
    For information on categories of offences and types of penalties, students should refer to <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71">Policy 71</a>. For typical penalties check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/guidelines/guidelines-assessment-penalties">Guidelines for the Assessment of Penalties</a>.
  </li>
  <br/>
  <li>
    <span style="font-weight:bold">Appeals:</span> A decision made or penalty imposed under <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-70">Policy 70</a>, Student Petitions and Grievances (other than a petition) or <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71">Policy 71</a>, Student Discipline may be appealed if there is a ground. A student who believes they have a ground for an appeal should refer to <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-72">Policy 72</a>, Student Appeals.
  </li>
</ul>

  <span style="font-weight:bold;">Intellectual Property:</span> Students should be aware that this course contains the intellectual property of their instructor, TA, and/or the University of Waterloo.  Intellectual property includes items such as: <br/>
  <ul>
    <li> Lecture content, spoken and written (and any audio/video recording thereof); </li>
    <li> Lecture handouts, presentations, and other materials prepared for the course (e.g., PowerPoint slides); </li>
    <li> Questions or solution sets from various types of assessments (e.g., assignments, quizzes, tests, final exams); and </li>
    <li> Work protected by copyright (e.g., any work authored by the instructor or TA or used by the instructor or TA with permission of the copyright owner).</li>
  </ul>
  <p> 
    Course materials and the intellectual property contained therein, are used to enhance a student’s educational experience.  However, sharing this intellectual property without the intellectual property owner’s permission is a violation of intellectual property rights.  For this reason, it is necessary to ask the instructor, TA and/or the University of Waterloo for permission before uploading and sharing the intellectual property of others online (e.g., to an online repository).
  </p>
  <p> 
    Permission from an instructor, TA or the University is also necessary before sharing the intellectual property of others from completed courses with students taking the same/similar courses in subsequent terms/years.  In many cases, instructors might be happy to allow distribution of certain materials.  However, doing so without expressed permission is considered a violation of intellectual property rights.
  </p>
  <p> 
    Please alert the instructor if you become aware of intellectual property belonging to others (past or present) circulating, either through the student body or online.  The intellectual property rights owner deserves to know (and may have already given their consent).
  </p>

  <span style="font-weight:bold;"> Use of Generative Artificial Intelligence: </span> The following statement is prepared by the Office of Academic Integrity with input from the Centre for Teaching Excellence, Library, and consultations with Associate Deans and members of the Standing Committee on New Technologies, Pedagogy, and Academic Integrity (Last Updated: August 2023):
  
      <p> Generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) trained using large language models (LLM) or other methods to produce text, images, music, or code, like Chat GPT, DALL-E, or GitHub CoPilot, may be used for assignments in this class with proper documentation, citation, and acknowledgement. Recommendations for how to cite GenAI in student work at the University of Waterloo may be found through the <a href="https://subjectguides.uwaterloo.ca/chatgpt_generative_ai">Library</a>. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Please be aware that generative AI is known to falsify references to other work and may fabricate facts and inaccurately express ideas. GenAI generates content based on the input of other human authors and may therefore contain inaccuracies or reflect biases.
        In addition, you should be aware that the legal/copyright status of generative AI inputs and outputs is unclear. Exercise caution when using large portions of content from AI sources, especially images. More information is available from the <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/copyright-at-waterloo/teaching/generative-artificial-intelligence">Copyright Advisory Committee</a>. 
      </p>
      <p>
        You are accountable for the content and accuracy of all work you submit in this class, including any supported by generative AI.
      </p>
